Walter LIVE is a party game adaptation of the Swiss card game "Der wahre Walter".

It is a web-based multiscreen game inspired by Jackbox games like _Quiplash._ To play, you simply visit the games' [website](walter.imakethings.ch) on a laptop or tablet and each player logs in with their own smartphone. You don't need to install anything.

The technology behind the system is powered by a node.js based backend hosted on Heroku, and a vue.js based frontend for both the host UI and the player UI.

In each round of this game, one player assumes the role of the _Sphinx._ In each round, the players are tasked to complete three sentences with gaps marked as **WALTER**. The _Sphinx_  also completes these three sentences. The other players' goal is to impersonate the _Sphinx_ as well as possible, because after the round ends, all answers are revealed and the players guess which entry is the one from the _Sphinx._ Whomever tricks another player into selecting their answer, gets points!

This game came in especially handy during the COVID-19 quarantine, because it can easily be played through your favourite video chat service.
