During these last couple of months, we've had an especially hard time finding inspiration. Hand-in-hand with the pandemic came isolation and our processes, which rely heavily on iteration and feedback loops, suddenly stood still. We took our time at [HackZurich 2020](https://hackzurich.com/) to figure out a way to give creative professionals back their flow.

Our platform allows users to upload general ideas or fully-fletched concepts and matches them with another creative pro - either with a colleague inside their company or a stranger in Australia. Any creative stuck in a rut can log into our tool and request someone else's opinion on either a small portion of his work or an overall idea. After completing a short onboarding users immediately get the chance to share their work. Their session is then matched to another creative from the requested expertise. The canvas allows for notes, free drawing, creating visual aids by using shapes, and adding pictures. The sessions can be saved and reaccessed at any point in time. A painless and beautifully packaged tool to reinspire creatives to collaborate.

Bounce was built with scalability in mind. We chose Firebase as the backend for our application because it provides a wide toolset of real-time optimized APIs, like the Firestore database. The Platform lives in the web and is touch-optimized, making it easy to switch devices and to work from afar. For easy deployments and hosting, we make use of Firebase Hosting.

Our proof of concept is finished and running live at [bounce-ideas-web-app.](https://bounce-ideas.web.app/ "bounce-ideas.web.app")

We would love for our platform to help other creatives out and inspire new crafts as well as new connections. Ideas for expansion:

* Real-time collaboration on the canvas
* Notify feedback matches via push notifications
* Chat feature (& Video calls?)
