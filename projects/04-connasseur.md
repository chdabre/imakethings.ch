At the [BärnHäckt](https://www.bernhackt.ch/) hackathon 2019 we were challenged by [SPF Consulting](https://www.spf-consulting.ch/) to create an app which makes the agonizing process of choosing a movie to watch easier.

We came up with the concept of a movie connässeur - somewhat of a concierge, who asks you about your preferences, and evaluates your current mood - and then serves you with 3 perfect choices of movies to watch.

In the 48 hours of hacking, we created a UI prototype and a proof of concept of our unique two-stage recommendation algorithm, which first generates a generic netflix-like choice of movies you might want to watch, and then picks out three which match your current mood.

At the end of an intense but rewarding development sprint, we were chosen as the 1st place winners!

We are planning to pick up development of the app again soon.
